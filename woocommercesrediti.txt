When working with a WordPress child theme and WooCommerce, it's a good practice to make CSS customizations in your child theme's styles rather 
than modifying the plugin's files directly. This way, your changes will be preserved even when the plugin is updated. Here's how you can include 
changes to WooCommerce CSS in your child theme:

1. **Create or Locate Your Child Theme:**
   If you've already set up a child theme, great! If not, create a child theme by creating a new directory within your WordPress themes directory 
   and adding the necessary files (`style.css`, `functions.php`, etc.). If you're unsure how to do this, you can find guides online.

2. **Enqueue Your Child Theme's Stylesheet:**
   Open the `functions.php` file of your child theme and use the `wp_enqueue_style` function to enqueue your child theme's stylesheet. 
   Make sure to include the WooCommerce stylesheet as well. Here's an example of how to enqueue styles in your child theme's `functions.php`:

   ```php
   function child_theme_enqueue_styles() {
       // Enqueue parent theme stylesheet
       wp_enqueue_style('parent-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/style.css');

       // Enqueue child theme stylesheet
       wp_enqueue_style('child-style', get_stylesheet_uri(), array('parent-style'));

       // Enqueue WooCommerce stylesheet
       wp_enqueue_style('woocommerce-style', get_template_directory_uri() . '/woocommerce.css', array('child-style'));
   }
   add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'child_theme_enqueue_styles');
   ```

3. **Create Your WooCommerce CSS File:**
   In your child theme's directory, create a file named `woocommerce.css`. This is where you'll put your custom WooCommerce CSS.

4. **Add Custom CSS to Your WooCommerce CSS File:**
   Open the `woocommerce.css` file you just created and add your custom CSS rules. You can target WooCommerce elements using specific classes 
   or IDs to apply your desired changes.

5. **Update Your Child Theme's Stylesheet (Optional):**
   If you prefer to organize your styles in the main child theme `style.css` rather than a separate file, you can directly 
   add your custom WooCommerce CSS rules there.

6. **Activate Your Child Theme:**
   Make sure your child theme is activated in the WordPress admin dashboard.

By following these steps, your custom WooCommerce CSS will be included in your child theme and won't be overridden by plugin updates. 
This approach separates your customizations from the plugin's files, ensuring that your changes are maintained even when WooCommerce is updated.

Remember that when targeting specific WooCommerce elements with your custom CSS, you might need to use more specific selectors or 
add `!important` to your rules in some cases to ensure your styles are applied correctly.
