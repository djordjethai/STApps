One of the most profound experiments in physics is one you may never have heard of. It’s the torsion-balance experiment at the University of Washington (and others like it elsewhere in the world).
This group, led by Eric Adelberger, has recently garnered attention for testing Newton’s inverse-square law of gravity down to a tenth of a millimeter. This experiment is interesting because there are good (or at least plausible) reasons to suspect that Newtonian gravity actually breaks down at around a millimeter. In particular, models with large extra dimensions of space can unify the scales of quantum gravity and particle physics if there are two extra dimensions about a millimeter in size. The Washington group has placed significant constraints on this fascinating idea.
But the profound experiment I’m referring to is the one about “testing the equivalence principle.” The Equivalence Principle is Einstein’s idea that you can’t tell, if you are sitting in a sealed laboratory, whether your lab is on the surface of a gravitating body or accelerating through space at uniform acceleration. So if the EP is right, uncharged bodies should all fall at the same rate in a gravitational field, just as they would in an accelerating rocket.
