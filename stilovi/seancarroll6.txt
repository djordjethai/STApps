The other important point about this work is that it puts to rest the vicious rumors we were hearing over a year ago, about which Eric Adelberger (leader of the Eot-Wash group) was nice enough to comment here. Namely, the rumor that they had actually found a weak repulsive force in their data. This is the kind of thing that happens all the time when you’re doing ultra-precise measurements at the very edge of what is possible; unforeseen effects creep in, and it takes time to stamp out everything that shouldn’t be there. These guys are careful, and would never jump up and down about a real effect unless they were truly convinced it was there. If I had been in charge (putting aside for the moment the fact that, if the experiment relied on my technical expertise, the lower limit on the size of extra dimensions would probably be measured in kilometers), I would probably have floated that rumor intentionally, just so people paid attention when the results did come out. Unlike me, Eric Adelberger has enormous integrity, so they just told the honest truth all along.
Chad keeps saying that these experiments don’t get enough credit, but I don’t know why he thinks that. (Chad, why do you think that?) Ever since the idea of large extra dimensions was floated in 1998, everyone working in string theory, particle physics, and cosmology has been very excited by the search for short-range forces, and most everyone knows that the Eot-Wash group is kicking butt within the field. Their 2000 paper, which pushed the limit on extra dimensions below a millimeter for the first time, has hundreds of citations, and Adelberger gets far more invitations to give colloquia and conference talks than he can possibly accept. Some influential theorists have even described the torsion-balance work as one of the most profound experiments in physics. This is not exactly a small, under-the-radar operation. We’re all looking forward to what they do next.
