Gravity is the most obvious of the four forces of nature (gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces). It’s also the first for which we had a sensible physical theory: Newton’s law of universal gravitation. Now we have sensible theories for all four of the forces, and Newton’s theory has been superseded by an even better theory, Einstein’s general relativity (GR).
GR has passed a series of experimental challenges with flying colors: the precession of Mercury, deflection of light, gravitational redshift and time delay, gravitational radiation from the binary pulsar, and the expansion rate of the early universe during the nucleosynthesis era. But it doesn’t quite fit in with the rest of physics, since the other three forces seem to be compatible with quantum mechanics in a way isn’t so obvious for gravity. So very few people really believe that general relativity is the final answer; at some point we’ll have to invent a better model (string theory being the leading candidate) that is intrinsically quantum-mechanical yet reduces to GR in the appropriate regimes.
Usually in field theory, if a model works well in a certain regime, you might expect it to break down at shorter distances or higher energies, but continue to be successful at long distances and lower energies. Nevertheless, people have begun to ask whether general relativity might be okay in the solar system but break down on much larger scales (galaxy- or universe-sized distances). The primary motivation for such suggestions is the fact we need to hypothesize dark matter and dark energy to make sense of our universe if GR is correct. It is very likely that GR is correct, and dark matter and dark energy are both for real, but since we can’t be sure we consider the possibility that our understanding of gravity is to blame.
