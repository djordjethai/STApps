Write a one page summary. Be sure to describe every topic and the name used in the text. Try to refer to speaker names. Write it as a bulletpoints and not as you are summarizing a text. Write only in Serbian language. Give it a Title and subtitles where appropriate and use caps lock to make what you marked as a title stand out.
